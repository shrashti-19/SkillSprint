## What Does This App Do?

SkillSprint helps people build good habits by making it like a game:
- Create challenges (like "Read 30 minutes daily" or "Code for 1 hour")
- Track your daily progress 
- Keep streaks going (like Snapchat streaks!)
- Compete with friends on leaderboards
- Get smart notifications to stay motivated

## üî• Cool Features I Built
